Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?

   Bitbucket is a Git repository management solution that allows you to manage your source code. It allows you to clone, pull and commit your source code between multiple people, and even has an inbuilt Cloud feature.

  Github is also a Git repository service, where you can clone your source code down to your own computer, and make additions of your own. A unique feature of Github is the 'forking' feature, which allows users to copy a repository from one users account to another.

  Although both sites are very effective in creating version control for users, Bitbucket has more of an edge over Github, for a few reasons. Bitbucket gives you unlimited private repositories, it has better pricing for private work, and it has smarter semantic searching.


  * Who made the last commit to repository A?

    Emma Walker


  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

    Emma Walker 

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

    Dave Pearce 

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

    The last commit from Repository A was August 2nd, 2018, so this is not an active project anymore. 
    The last commit from Repository B was 23 days ago, so it could be considered more active than A.

    I think Repository B is still active, as the last commit states that its preparing for the next release version.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?



# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
